# Virtual-Mouse
This project uses computer vision to control the mouse cursor with hand gestures, eliminating the need for a physical mouse. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, it tracks hand landmarks via webcam and translates gestures into cursor movement and click actions. Ideal for hands-free control or accessibility solutions.
